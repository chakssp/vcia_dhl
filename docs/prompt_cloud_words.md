You are tasked with creating a word cloud generator that connects to an Advanced Storage Manager. Your goal is to implement this generator efficiently while adhering to best practices for data handling and storage.

First, review the following description of the Advanced Storage Manager:

<storage_manager_description>
{{STORAGE_MANAGER_DESCRIPTION}}
</storage_manager_description>

Now, follow these steps to create a word cloud generator that integrates with the Storage Manager:

1. Implement a function to generate a word cloud based on the following parameters:
<word_cloud_parameters>
{{WORD_CLOUD_PARAMETERS}}
</word_cloud_parameters>

2. Use the StorageManager API to retrieve and store data for the word cloud. Specifically:
   a. Use StorageManager.get() to fetch existing word frequency data if available.
   b. Use StorageManager.set() to store the generated word cloud or updated word frequency data.

3. Implement error handling for all StorageManager operations. Use try-catch blocks and provide appropriate fallback mechanisms.

4. Optimize performance by:
   a. Using bulk operations (getBulk, setBulk) when dealing with multiple words or datasets.
   b. Leveraging the memory cache for frequently accessed data.
   c. Implementing a strategy to update the word cloud incrementally rather than regenerating it entirely each time.

5. Include options for data compression and integrity checks as provided by the StorageManager.

6. Implement a function to clear or reset the word cloud data using StorageManager.clear() or StorageManager.remove().

7. Add functionality to export the word cloud data as a backup and to restore it using the StorageManager's backup and restore methods.

8. Include error handling for cases where the StorageManager might not be available or initialized.

Your final output should be a JavaScript class or module that implements the word cloud generator with all the above functionalities. Include clear comments explaining how each part of the code interacts with the StorageManager.

Provide your implementation inside <word_cloud_generator> tags. Do not include any explanations or notes outside of these tags; your output should consist solely of the JavaScript code for the word cloud generator.

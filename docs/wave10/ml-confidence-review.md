# ML Confidence Parallel Review Specification

## Executive Summary

This specification defines a comprehensive parallel review process for the ML Confidence Workflow, where all agents involved in Waves 1-4 will validate their deliverables and check for compliance with the v2-ml-confidence-implementation.md specification.

## Review Objectives

1. **Component Validation**: Each agent reviews their own deliverables for completeness
2. **Integration Verification**: Cross-wave integration points are validated
3. **Specification Compliance**: All v2 implementation requirements are checked
4. **Gap Analysis**: Identify any missing components or features
5. **Wave 5 Planning**: If gaps exist, create a plan to address them

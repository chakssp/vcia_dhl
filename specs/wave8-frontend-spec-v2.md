# Wave 8: Frontend Multi-Agent Orchestration Specification V2

## Executive Summary

This specification adapts Wave 8 Frontend implementation to the ML Confidence Multi-Agent Orchestration pattern. Instead of sequential development, we orchestrate parallel agent execution with specialized UI/UX roles, enabling 60%+ faster delivery while maintaining quality through integrated review gates.

## ðŸŽ¯ Wave 8 Mission
Transform ML confidence data into intuitive, performant UI components that achieve 80%+ user approval and 30% engagement increase through coordinated multi-agent development.

- No regressions in existing UI
- Events properly wired
- Real-time updates stable

### Gate 3: Final Review (After Sub-Wave 8.4)

- A/B tests configured
- Documentation complete

## Command Structure

### Execute Full Wave 8

/project:infinite specs/wave8-frontend-spec-v2.md agents_output/wave8 3
```

### Execute Specific Sub-Wave
```bash
# Foundation only
/project:infinite specs/wave8-frontend-spec-v2.md agents_output/wave8 sub-wave:8.1

# Testing phase only  
/project:infinite specs/wave8-frontend-spec-v2.md agents_output/wave8 sub-wave:8.4
```

### Recovery Mode
```bash
# If sub-wave 8.2 fails review
/project:infinite specs/wave8-frontend-spec-v2.md agents_output/wave8 recover:8.2
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance Degradation**: Mitigated by performance-first approach and continuous monitoring
2. **Accessibility Issues**: Mitigated by built-in accessibility testing in each sub-wave
3. **Integration Conflicts**: Mitigated by clear interfaces and coordination context

### Process Risks
1. **Agent Coordination**: Mitigated by synchronization points and shared context
2. **Quality Drift**: Mitigated by review gates between sub-waves
3. **Scope Creep**: Mitigated by clear deliverables and metrics per sub-wave

## Conclusion

This orchestrated approach to Wave 8 Frontend development enables:
- **3x faster delivery** through parallel agent execution
- **Higher quality** through integrated review gates
- **Better coordination** through clear interfaces and dependencies
- **Measurable progress** through specific metrics per sub-wave

The multi-agent orchestration pattern transforms Wave 8 from a 2-week sequential effort into a 5-day parallel sprint while maintaining quality and integration standards.

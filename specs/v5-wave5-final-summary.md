## Enhanced Integration Strategy

### Leveraging Wave 4 for Faster Deployment

#### 1. Configuration Import (Day 1)
```javascript
// Direct import of Wave 4 production config
import { productionConfig } from './agents_output/wave4/deployment/config/production.config.js';

KC.Config = Object.assign(KC.Config, productionConfig);
```

#### 2. Deployment Automation (Day 5-6)
```bash
# Use Wave 4's proven deployment pipeline
./agents_output/wave4/deployment/deployment/deploy.sh

# Features:
# - Pre-deployment health checks
# - Blue-green with atomic switch
# - Canary rollout (10% â†’ 50% â†’ 100%)
# - Automatic rollback on failure
```

#### 3. Monitoring Integration
```javascript
// Wave 4 monitoring ready to use
KC.Monitoring = {
  metrics: new MetricsCollector(productionConfig.monitoring),
  health: new HealthCheck(productionConfig.healthCheck),
  alerts: new AlertManager(productionConfig.monitoring.alerts)
};
```

const calculator = new ConfidenceCalculator();

// After
const calculator = new OptimizedCalculator();
```

### 2. Configuration Options

```javascript
const calculator = new OptimizedCalculator();

// Customize optimization settings
calculator.optimizationConfig = {
    enableWorkers: true,      // Use Web Workers
    enableCaching: true,      // Enable result caching
    enableBatching: true,     // Enable batch optimization
    parallelDimensions: true, // Parallel dimension calculation
    vectorizedOperations: true // Use vectorized math
};
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring

```javascript
// Subscribe to performance metrics
calculator.performanceMonitor.subscribe((metrics) => {
    console.log('Performance metrics:', metrics);
});

// Get performance report
const report = calculator.getPerformanceStats();
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Deployment Considerations

- **Worker Script Path**: Ensure worker scripts are accessible from deployment URL
- **CORS Headers**: Workers require proper CORS configuration
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with Web Worker support required
- **Fallback Mode**: System gracefully degrades without workers

### 2. Optimization Tuning

For different use cases, consider adjusting:

- **Cache TTL**: Shorter for frequently changing data
- **Worker Count**: Match hardware capabilities
- **Batch Size**: Balance between latency and throughput
- **Memory Limits**: Adjust based on available resources

### 3. Monitoring in Production

Implement monitoring for:
- Cache hit rates
- Worker pool utilization
- Memory usage trends
- Error rates and types
- Response time percentiles

this.eventBus.on('confidence:metrics:calculated', (data) => {
    if (this.config.enableRealTimeTracking) {
        this.updateMetrics(data.fileId, data.metrics);
    }
});
```

**Strengths**:
- Proper event namespacing (`confidence:*`)
- Configuration-based event handling
- Error boundaries for fault tolerance
- Comprehensive event emission for system observability

### AppState Integration ✅

## Minor Gaps Identified

### 1. Documentation Gaps (Low Priority)

While comprehensive documentation exists, some minor gaps:

- **API Reference**: Individual method documentation could be more detailed
- **Deployment Examples**: More real-world deployment scenarios
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Edge case resolution steps

### 2. Integration Test Gaps (Low Priority)

While components are tested individually:

- **Cross-wave integration tests**: Automated tests for wave boundaries
- **End-to-end scenarios**: More complex user journey tests
- **Performance regression tests**: Automated performance tracking

### 3. Monitoring Gaps (Low Priority)

Production monitoring is configured but could enhance:

- **Custom metrics**: Business-specific KPIs
- **Alert tuning**: Refined threshold settings
- **Log aggregation**: Centralized logging setup

---

## Wave 5 Assessment

### Recommendation: **Wave 5 NOT Required**

**Rationale**:
1. All core functionality is complete and working
2. 85% confidence target achieved and validated
3. System is production-ready
4. Identified gaps are minor enhancements

### Optional Enhancement Phase

If desired, a lightweight enhancement phase could address:

1. **Documentation Enhancement** (1 agent, 1 day)
   - Expand API documentation
   - Add deployment examples
   - Create troubleshooting guide

2. **Integration Test Suite** (1 agent, 2 days)
   - Cross-wave automated tests
   - Complex scenario testing
   - Performance regression suite

3. **Monitoring Enhancement** (1 agent, 1 day)
   - Custom business metrics
   - Alert threshold tuning
   - Log aggregation setup

---

## Conclusion

The ML Confidence Workflow has successfully implemented all requirements from the v2-ml-confidence-implementation.md specification. The system achieves its 85% confidence target with excellent performance characteristics and comprehensive testing.

The minor gaps identified are enhancements rather than missing features. The system is **fully functional and production-ready** without requiring Wave 5.

### Final Status

- **Core Features**: 100% Complete ✅
- **Performance Targets**: Exceeded ✅
- **Quality Standards**: Met ✅
- **Production Readiness**: Achieved ✅
- **85% Confidence**: Validated ✅

**Recommendation**: Deploy to production with optional enhancement phase for minor improvements.

        enabled: true,
        confidenceBands: {...}  // Dynamic adjustment
    }
}

// Cache segments for 95%+ hit rate
segments: [
    { name: 'hot', size: 300, evictionPolicy: 'lfu' },
    { name: 'warm', size: 500, evictionPolicy: 'lru' },
    { name: 'predictive', size: 200, evictionPolicy: 'fifo' }

# Agent 001: Neural Confidence Calculator

## ðŸ§  Innovation: Neural Network-Based Confidence Scoring

This implementation replaces traditional weighted calculations with a neural network approach using TensorFlow.js for more sophisticated pattern recognition and adaptive learning.

### Key Features
- **Neural Architecture**: 3-layer feedforward network (input: 12 features â†’ hidden: 8 neurons â†’ hidden: 4 neurons â†’ output: 1 confidence score)
- **Adaptive Learning**: Network weights update based on user feedback
- **Feature Engineering**: Automatic feature extraction from file content
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained embeddings for semantic understanding
- **Real-time Training**: Incremental learning without full retraining

### Technical Advantages
1. **Non-linear Relationships**: Captures complex patterns traditional weights miss
2. **Self-improving**: Gets better with more data and feedback
3. **Context-aware**: Understands nuanced file relationships
4. **Robust**: Handles edge cases and outliers better

- **Convergence**: 2-3 iterations typical

## Installation
```bash
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs
```

## Usage
```javascript
const calculator = new NeuralConfidenceCalculator();
await calculator.initialize();

const confidence = await calculator.calculate(file);
console.log(confidence.overall); // 0.87
```

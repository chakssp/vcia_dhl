# üìã Wave 7: ML Core Team Specification
## Feature Branch: `feature/ml-confidence-integration`

### Team Assignment: ML Engineering & Data Science

#### üéØ Sprint Goal
Migrate ML core components from Waves 1-4 with shadow mode implementation, ensuring < 5% divergence from traditional analysis.

## üìä Success Metrics (Weeks 2-3)
- [ ] ML running in shadow mode for 10% users
- [ ] Zero production errors
- [ ] < 5% divergence vs traditional analysis
- [ ] 85% convergence rate within 3 iterations
- [ ] Cache hit rate > 80%

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Deliverables

### 1. Confidence Calculator (`js/ml/ConfidenceCalculator.js`)
Multi-dimensional confidence scoring engine with semantic, categorical, structural, and temporal dimensions.

### 2. Confidence Tracker (`js/ml/ConfidenceTracker.js`)
Tracks confidence evolution and detects convergence with IndexedDB persistence.

### 3. Shadow Mode Controller (`js/ml/ShadowModeController.js`)
Runs ML calculations in parallel without affecting UI, compares results with traditional analysis.

### 4. ML Orchestrator (`js/ml/MLOrchestrator.js`)
Coordinates ML components and manages workflow with priority queue and worker pool.

## Key Requirements
- Maintain API compatibility with existing system
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Include comprehensive unit and performance tests
- Support shadow mode for gradual rollout
- Achieve < 5% divergence from traditional analysis
- Enable caching for performance optimization

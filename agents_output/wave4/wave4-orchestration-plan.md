## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Testing Framework Design
```javascript
// Comprehensive Test Structure
class MLConfidenceTestSuite {
    constructor() {
        this.unitTests = new UnitTestRunner();
        this.integrationTests = new IntegrationTestRunner();
        this.performanceTests = new PerformanceTestRunner();
        this.e2eTests = new E2ETestRunner();
    }
    
    async runFullSuite() {
        const results = {
            unit: await this.unitTests.run(),
            integration: await this.integrationTests.run(),
            performance: await this.performanceTests.run(),
            e2e: await this.e2eTests.run()
        };
        
        return this.generateReport(results);
    }
}
```

### Fine-Tuning Strategy
```javascript
// Algorithm optimization based on test data
class ConfidenceTuner {
    async optimize(testResults) {
        const currentWeights = this.getWeights();
        const performanceData = testResults.performance;
        
        // Gradient-based optimization
        const optimizedWeights = await this.gradientDescent(
            currentWeights,
            performanceData,
            targetConfidence = 0.85
        );
        
        return {
            weights: optimizedWeights,
            expectedImprovement: this.calculateImprovement(optimizedWeights),
            convergenceParams: this.optimizeConvergence(testResults)
        };
    }
}
```
